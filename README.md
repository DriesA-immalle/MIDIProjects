# MIDIProjects
*All of these projects were made using the Behringer BCF2000.*

## MidiCounter
This program will make all the sliders and lights (on p-1) go up and down/ on and off. 
## MidiPong
Thank you Catho and Laurens for letting me use this code. Use slider 1 and 8 to control and play a small game of pong.
## MidiSlider
This program can read the value of all buttons and makes it possible to use a virtual slider to control the value of every slider using a number from 1-8.
## MidiStaircase
This program makes the sliders do a form of staircase/wave.
