# MIDIProjects
*All of these projects were made using the Behringer BCF2000.*

## MidiCounter
This program will make all the sliders and lights (on p-1) go up and down / on and off. 
## MidiPong
Thank you Catho and Laurens for letting me use this code. Use slider 1 and 8 to control and play a small game of pong.
Using the buttons above these sliders triggers the AI to take over. Using some of the knobs on the top give you the ability to live alter the game.
## MidiSlider
This program can read the value of all buttons and makes it possible to use a virtual slider to control the value of every slider using a number from 1-8.
## MidiStaircase
This program makes the sliders do a form of staircase/wave.
